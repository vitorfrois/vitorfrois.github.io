#     description: The radioactive element astatine exists only in trace amounts in nature. Its properties can therefore only be explored by study of the minute quantities of artificially produced isotopes or by performing theoretical calculations. One of the most important properties influencing the chemical behaviour is the energy required to remove one electron from the valence shell, referred to as the ionization potential.

Computers amazed me since I was a kid. Now I study them. 

I am a Computer Science undergraduated student at University of São Paulo (USP). I see the university as a great oportunity to meet amazing people and participate in wide variety of projects. Therefore, I currently work at USP data science extension group, [DATA](http://data.icmc.usp.br/), where we conduct presentations, classes and content about related topics. Recently I started a Scientific Research oriented by Francisco Rodrigues, which uses Machine Learning to predict the steps required to reach stationary states in discrete-time social dynamics within complex networks, based on their topology. It. Our goal is to analyze the impact of topology in social dynamics.

Besides the academic interests, my hobbies include playing chess, football, running and cooking. You can follow me at [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/Chessfrois) and challenge me for a game. Unfortunately (or not) it is not possible yet to see me playing football.

<!-- # I currently intern at Clave Capital Risk area, where I can apply my knowledge with Python, SQL, Web Scraping and other important tools.

# At USP I research about Complex Networks and participate on DATA and SEMCOMP extension groups.

# My curriculum is available here but you also can see some projects I've made at my GitHub, and contact me via LinkedIn or send me an email


# I am a chemical element with the symbol At and atomic number 85. I am 
# the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust, occurring only as
# the decay product of various heavier elements. All of my isotopes are
# short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. 

# A pure sample of myself has never been assembled, because any macroscopic
# specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity. -->
