Computers amazed me since I was a kid. Now I study them. 

I am a Computer Science undergrad student at University of São Paulo (USP) and work as Content Engineer at [Briefer](https://briefer.cloud/blog/). I see the university as a great oportunity to meet amazing people and participate in a wide variety of projects. I coordinated activities at ML & DS Extension Group [DATA](http://data.icmc.usp.br/) that included presentations, events and seminars. I also work as Scientific Research Assistant with Francisco Rodrigues to predict influence of spreaders in complex systems.

Besides the academic interests, my hobbies include playing chess, football, running and cooking. You can follow me at [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/Chessfrois) and challenge me for a game. Unfortunately (or not) it is not possible yet to see me playing football.
