    <p>Unite two passions like chess and computers is an old hobby that
started long time ago when I created an website to agregate chess info
around the net. There was a long time ago, and having the opportunity to
make another project involving chess make me curious.</p>
<p>The youtuber <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague">Sebastian Lague</a>
developed a challenge between its followers with the objective of
creating the most powerful Chess Bot within a limit of characters in C#.
Together with some university colleagues, we created the <a
href="https://github.com/icmc-data/tiny-chess-bots">Saint Charles
Bot</a> (named after our campus city).</p>
<p>But the bot did not work as expected. Fitting a Neural Network, our
main goal, into the limit of 2048 tokens proposed by Sebastian turned
out to be a pain. In the end, we sent a simple version of the bot just
for fun. The story did not end there, tough. After the challenge, we
trascribed the code to Python to create Pyrarucu. Its name is based on
the powerful chess bots Rybka, Stockfish, which references fishes, with
a touch of brasility. You can challenge it for a game at <a
href="https://lichess.org/@/Pyrarucu">Lichess</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to give a idea of the main challenges and tips
of building a chess bot with machine learning.</p>
<h4 id="dataset">Dataset</h4>
<p>In this project I choosen to work with supervised learning
techniques. The dataset <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronakbadhe/chess-evaluations">Chess
Evaluations</a> have millions of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation">FEN</a>
positions with theier respective analizys by a strong chess computer <a
href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a> which will work as
training data for my Neural Network.</p>
<h4 id="bitboard">Bitboard</h4>
<p>A bitboard is a very common way of storing bits in computer games,
where each bit represents a piece or a space. In our case, the bitboard
is a tool that helps produce a vector representation of the Chess
board.</p>
<p>There are 12 different types of pieces in the game, including the
white pawn, the white bishop, … and the black king. Thus, each piece can
receive its representation in bitboards, which is a vector of size 64
(there is a space for each square on the board) and receives the value 1
if the piece is located there and 0 otherwise.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">../img/bitboard.gif</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="evaluation-function-and-neural-network">Evaluation Function and
Neural Network</h4>
<p>Put it simple, an analysis function is a function that given an board
state, returns a number that indicates the advantages of each side. If
the value is positive, white pieces have an advantage and vice
versa.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../img/evaluation.png" alt="evaluation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">evaluation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each entry of the dataset has an evaluation by Stockfish and we
should create a network that better approximate its behaviour.</p>
<p>Initially, we transform the FEN positions in bitboards. With a vector
of bitboards and respecitive evaluations, we can train a neural network
and use it as our analysis function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>X <span class="op">=</span> df[<span class="st">&#39;FEN&#39;</span>].<span class="bu">apply</span>(fen_to_bit_array).to_list()</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>y <span class="op">=</span> df[<span class="st">&#39;Evaluation&#39;</span>]</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>reg <span class="op">=</span> MLPRegressor().fit(X, Y)</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>reg.predict(X_test)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">0.07698299</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="search-function">Search Function</h4>
<p>With the evaluation function in hands, we should find a way of making
the better move. To do so, we create a tree, where the root node is the
current position and each edge is a move that leads to a different
position.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../img/minmax.png" alt="minmax" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">minmax</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This way, we should search for the move that maximizes our advantage
and minimizes the opponent. The algorithm that makes this search is
called MinMax. Pyrarucu uses a improved version of MinMax that cuts from
tree moves according to a lower and upper bound in a way that with less
nodes to search, it runs faster.</p>
<p>With these steps, we have a functional bot that receives a board
state and replies with the best move. <em>Or at least his best
move</em>. You can see the full code to <a
href="https://github.com/icmc-data/Pyrarucu/">Pyrarucu at Github</a>. If
you are interested in coding chess bots, I encourage you to take a look
at <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page">Chess
Programming Wiki</a>, a repository of knowledge about everything we know
about chess computer.</p>
